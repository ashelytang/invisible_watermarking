# invisible_watermarking

Currently utilizing the BLINDWATERMARK github repo to test out images as watermarks for images.
Will continue utilizing this method to obtain metrics after we curate a dataset of various images.

Will test the method on a video before creating a dataset of videos.
Will also test this method on deep fakes or AI-generated images.
